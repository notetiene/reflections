When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

     I don't know yet. It seems silly for me.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

     Because it can easily break things. If I make a commit locally & there's
     an other one on the remote repository, there may be some conflicts.
