When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

     I don't know yet. It seems silly for me.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

     Because it can easily break things. If I make a commit locally & there's
     an other one on the remote repository, there may be some conflicts.
     
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use
one instead of another?

     Branches are different commits not related to each others. Clones are copies
     of a repository. Fork is a distant copy of a distant repository.
     - Branches are good to make experiments.
     - Clones are good to modify a project locally.
     - Fork are useful when collaborating & giving credits.
