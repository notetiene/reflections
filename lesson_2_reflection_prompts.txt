What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

     When I want to do experimental changes or I'm trying to fix bugs. It's

     be useful for sharing with the public, but as the name would say,
     it's experimental.

What are the pros and cons of Git automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

     Automatic merging merging is really fast compared to manual merge. It may,
     however sometimes be impossible. When the same part has been changed, git
     can't figure out which part to keep. It may be harder to make automatic
     merges when several people contributed.
